# Distributed Processing System - Matrices and Image Filtering

The project proposes a distributed processing system that efficiently handles operations on matrices and image filtering. Users submit their requests to a central server, which distributes tasks across available worker nodes. The distributed architecture ensures parallel execution of tasks, while an intuitive user interface simplifies task submission and tracking.

The project aims to provide a versatile solution for distributed data processing, adaptable to various application domains.

## Features

- Submit requests for matrix processing or image filtering to the central server.
- Distributed processing of tasks across multiple worker nodes via sockets or RMI.
- Ability to specify additional parameters for matrix operations and image filters.
- User-friendly graphical interface for the client, created using Swing with FlatLaf.
